***How it works?***<br>
Launching the software will show you Login page first. If you do not have user account yet, you may easily create one. Just clike Register User and create one.
After  creating the user, enter the user id and password and then click the Login button.

When you successfully login, you will be introduced with Home Page. From there you will see all the available features.

If you want to use it immediately, the only necessary thing is to add products. Customer and Supplier are optional. You can make buying/selling without having them registered.

If you want to add new product, click Products. Then Add New Product. Fill the corresponding fields and click add. Adding customer, supplier and user are also similar to adding products.

After adding products successfully, you are now ready to buy/sell goods. Click Sales to sell goods. If you want to sell to specific customer, just click Select Customer. When you select Product, the item will automatically add to the table. Click Quantity to update the quantity colum you want to sell. If everything is ready to sell, insert Cash Amount your customer paid to you. If the Change field turns green, you may see the Sell button enable to click. Just click it. Congratulations, you sold things!!! After selling, the quantity in Products will decrease.

Purchase goods or services is very similar to Selling. The only major difference is that after buying, the quantity of your product will increase.

If you want to see the actions you and other users made about sales, you can watch them at Sale Report. You can filter and watch them by Date, by Customer, by User or by Voucher. 
For buying, yoh can watch them at Purchase Report.<br>
That's all for the software.
