# Hmine-POS
Final Project for CS50

This software is developed using JavaFX.
Any computers that run Java (installed JDK or JRE) can run this software.

This software is named Hmine POS. A software for buying and selling goods and services.
Functions available in this software are
1. Create/Retrieve/Update Customer (whom you are going to sell goods to)
2. CRU Supplier (whom you are going to buy goods from)
3. CRU User (Users that can use this software)
4. CRU Product (Products that you are going to buy or sell)
5. Sale (Selling goods or services)
6. Purchase (Buying goods or services)

How it works?
Launching this software will show you Login page first.
If you do not have user account yet, you may easily create one.
Just clike Register User and create one.

When you successfully login, you will be introduced with Home Page.
From there you will see all of the available features.

If you want to use it immediately, the only necessary thing is to add products.
Customer and Supplier are optional. You can make buying/selling without having them registered.

If you want to add new product, click Products.
Then Add New Product. Fill the corresponding fields and click add.
Adding customer, supplier and user are also similar to adding products.

After adding products successfully, you are now ready to buy/sell goods. 
Click Sales to sell goods. If you want to sell to specific customer, just click Select Customer.
When you select Product, the item will automatically add to the table. 
Click Quantity to update the quantity colum you want to sell. 
If everything is ready to sell, insert Cash Amount your customer paid to you. 
If the Change field turns green, you may see the Sell button enable to click. Just click it.
Congratulations, you sold things!!! After selling, the quantity in Products will decrease. 

Purchase goods or services is very similar to Selling. The only major difference is that 
after buying, the quantity of your product will increase. 

That's all for the software.

Best regards,
Sai Saing Hmine Tun
